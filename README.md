# Occupation-Information
These Web APIs give occupations by keyword and associated details by entering an exact ONET title or code, and other filters. The search matches occupations in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) taxonomy, created by the Department of Labor for cross-agency use by federal, state and local government entities.
